					Hi! My name is Shu and I am a software developer.<br/><br/> 
					I became addicted to the world of programming in my junior year in high school. I found the topic hard to grasp in the beginning since it was unlike anything else I had learned in school. But I got the hang of it after a while and learned to love the art of programming. Since then I have improved my coding skills through college classes, hackathons, and personal projects.
					<br/><br/>
					Outside of programming, I really enjoy playing and recording music and hanging out with friends.

									I am an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor with senior level standing. I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering and am looking to minor in Physics as well. At Michigan, I tend to keep myself busy with music and work along with regular schoolwork. I also really enjoy attending hackathons where many of my personal projects were developed.

											Cask is a startup in Palo Alto which focuses on writing a cloud-based, big data application platform built on top of the Apache Hadoop infrastructure. As an intern, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and learned a tremendous amount from my experience. I worked on different aspects of one of the main products, CDAP. My most critical contribution was adding scalable HTTP service APIs that users could plug in to their existing CDAP applications to allow those apps to communicate via HTTP. Additionally, I have written applications using CDAP itself in order to showcase its abilities to end users.

												<span style="color: #ffffff;">Data Visualizer:</span> &nbspI wrote a big data application using CDAP which can be used to aggregate, correlate, and visualize data - for instance, metrics, logs, or any other events. Currently, it is being used to visualize the data for the test cases that Cask runs on their own platform. The app showcases the effectiveness of CDAP while helping Cask see how the platform is working throughout the development lifecycle.

											Design Lab 1 is a collaborative space for students and faculty to use at the University of Michigan. As a consultant, I am responsible for helping students and patrons who use our wide array of facilities. Alongside that, I work on my own personal projects to maintain and help promote use of this space. One of my projects was developing a drum machine that uses the Leap Motion hand tracking device to play different drum sounds. I also developed an online database to manage our current inventory of hardware using Google Spreadsheets and Google Apps Scripts.

The database keeps inventory and when new products need to be bought, a user can select the items, indicate the quantity needed, and click a button to move them to a separate sheet for purchasing. Then the person in charge of purchases can indicate that the items have been bought and the purchasing information will be stored.

											As a summer intern at the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Laboratory (RASL), I worked on many projects related to how autonomous systems can be used to improve Autism intervention. According to literature, children with Autism tend to interact better with autonomous systems rather than humans. This is likely because these systems do not exhibit as much emotion and spontaneity as humans do. We used this fact to develop systems that could aid in current Autism intervention protocols.</br>This is also where I was first introduced to the world of programming as well. My experience at this research facility played a crucial role in my choice to pursue programming as a profession.

											<span style="color:#ffffff">NAO Kinect Interface:</span> &nbspI worked on this project with a few other graduate and undergraduate students over the course of 2 summers. The goal of this project was to interface the NAO Humanoid robot with the Microsoft Kinect motion sensor. We worked on writing algorithms that allowed the robot to respond to human gesture. THe Kinect would detect the human's movements and the data would be analyzed in real time. Then the computer would tell the robot the appropriate course of action. This system was actually developed to help children with Autism. According to literature, these children tend to be less overwhelmed by robots rather than humans due to the robots' limited abilities and emotions. I was able to observe firsthand, how this system aided children with Autism through imitation learning. The robot would perform a gesture and then ask the child to repeat the gesture. If the child was correct, the robot would congratulate him and move to the next gesture. Otherwise, the robot would show what the child did wrong and would let the child try again. This project was presented at a conference:<br/>“Gesture Recognition using Commodity RGB-D Sensor for Imitation Learning Platform for Children with Autism.” HCI International (2013).

											<span style="color: #ffffff;">Heart Rate Sensitive Virtual Reality System:</span> &nbspThis was the first programming project I worked on at RASL and was one of the biggest reasons why I became interested in computer science. I built a heart rate sensor based off of an online circuit diagram. I then used an Arduino to read the analog output of the sensor with a computer. I filtered the data using Matlab in order to calculate the heart rate. Then I used a pong style game to challenege the user and increase his anxiety. If the heart rate increased different user sensitive thresholds, I had a virtual avatar give an appropriate verbal response. This project was more of a proof of concept about how autonomous systems can be changed based on the user's physiological state. I completed this project over the course of a summer internship and the work was published in a scholarly journal:<br/>

											Tidbits was a project I worked on with 3 other teammates at MHacks Fall 2014. We created a mobile app that let you store little bits of information for the people that matter to you the most. The app also sent you reminders to check up on contacts whom you had not spoken to in a while. We think this would be perfect for keeping in touch with friends as well as maintaining bits of information about people in your professional life as well.

We created a program that used the Leap Motion hand tracking device to play music. The system allowed the user to choose from 128 different instruments, and add effects like reverb to the sound by moving their hands in different directions. We also allowed the user to record whatever they played to a MIDI file so that it could be used in all of the common audio mixing software.
